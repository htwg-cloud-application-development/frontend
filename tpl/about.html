    <p>The master student project Scaly comes in on the advantages of cloud-computing to the administration at the University Technology, Business and Design Konstanz (HTWG) more effective in different events.</p>
    <p>It is intended to enable courses, as for example, "Einführung in die Programmierung" in which the Java programming is a priority. It is to be built for the evaluation of student software projects with "scaly” a cloud service. This automated evaluation based on student projects in different version control systems (GIT, SVN), which are deposited on the Moodle learning platform for individual students. Scaly makes use of already existing static analysis tools (check Style & PMD) to improvement in the source code to demonstrate and determine code duplicates for the lecturers. The use of scaly demands the students on the one hand with regard to their analytical thinking when programming, and leads to the other to a painstakingly operation.</p>
    <p>The processing of the project was carried out, in groups, in the spring term 2016 the lecture "Cloud Application Development”.</p>
